        <p>A whimsical vacation that's great for families, Isla de las Muñecas is also known as the Island of Dolls. Just south of Mexico City, the island is easily accessed by boat. Just don't fall in the water! Isla de las Muñecas started when the caretaker found a drowned little girl. Shortly thereafter, he saw a floating doll near the canals. Most probably, the doll belonged to the girl. He placed it in the trees to pay homage to the girl's lost soul. Sonn more and more dolls joined the collection until the island became what it is today. An exciting trip filled with history, lots of spirited playtime, and beautiful haunted waters.</p>
